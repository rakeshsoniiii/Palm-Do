Got it. You want a **Palm Pay Website** that works as a **secure, multi-modal, AI-driven touchless payment system**—palm + face + gesture + voice in under 7 seconds, plus emergency SOS and extra features like sign language, cardless identity, astrology, and greetings.

I’ll break it into four parts for you:

1. **Suggestions and additional features to add**
2. **How to make it free (tools, APIs, frameworks)**
3. **How to improve it for an AI contest**
4. **Sample README file with project structure**

---

## 1. Suggestions & Additional Features

* **Adaptive Authentication:**
  Depending on risk level (low transaction vs high-value transfer), system can require single (palm) or multi-modal (palm + face + gesture + voice) checks.

* **Offline Mode (Edge AI):**
  Allow small-value offline payments without internet by storing tokens locally and syncing later.

* **Dynamic Gesture PIN:**
  Instead of a fixed gesture, generate random gesture challenges (example: "show 3 fingers up") to prevent spoofing.

* **Contextual Awareness:**
  Payment system detects environment (public place vs. personal device) and adjusts security accordingly.

* **AI Fraud Detection:**
  Detect unusual spending patterns or forced behavior (shaky hands, stress voice tones).

* **Integration with Wearables:**
  Option to pair smartwatch or AR glasses for additional identity verification.

* **Gamification & Rewards:**
  Reward users with loyalty points or discounts for using Palm Pay instead of cards.

## 2. Free Tools and APIs

* **Palm & Gesture Recognition:**

  * [MediaPipe Hands](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe) (Google) → Free, runs on CPU, works in browser (WebAssembly/JS) and Python.
  * [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js) → For real-time gesture + palm recognition.

* **Face Recognition:**

  * [face-api.js](https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js) → Free, works in browser, lightweight.
  * [DeepFace (Python)](https://github.com/serengil/deepface) → Free open-source library.

* **Voice Recognition + TTS:**

  * [Vosk API](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/) → Free offline speech-to-text.
  * [Mozilla TTS](https://github.com/mozilla/TTS) → Free text-to-speech.
  * Browser-based → `SpeechRecognition` API + `speechSynthesis`.

* **Database & Identity Storage:**

  * SQLite (local testing), PostgreSQL (free hosting on [Supabase](https://supabase.com)).
  * [DigiLocker API](https://www.digilocker.gov.in/) (for government docs integration, if possible).

* **Liveness Detection (Anti-Deepfake):**

  * Blink detection, palm movement challenge → Implement with MediaPipe.

* **Web Hosting Free:**

  * GitHub Pages / Netlify (frontend).
  * Render / Railway (backend free tier).

## 3. How to Improve for AI Contest

* **Uniqueness:** Focus on "Universal Digital ID via Palm" (beyond just payments).
* **Privacy & Ethics:** Stress **federated learning** + **on-device processing** (no central raw biometric storage).
* **Impact:** Highlight rural use cases—touchless payments without expensive biometric scanners.
* **Inclusivity:** Indian Sign Language support + multi-language voice commands.
* **Fun Factor:** Palm reading AI + seasonal greetings → increases adoption & engagement.
* **Emergency Mode:** SOS with palm gesture + auto-sharing live location → strong safety appeal.

If presented well, this can stand out because it merges **security, payments, accessibility, and personalization**.

# Palm Pay — AI-Powered Touchless Payment System

## Overview

Palm Pay is a secure, fully software-based touchless payment and identity system.
It uses **AI-powered palm recognition, facial authentication, gesture confirmation, and voice commands** to complete UPI-like payments in under 7 seconds.
No hardware scanners are required—just a standard camera.

Beyond payments, Palm Pay also serves as a **Universal Digital ID** platform, allowing users to carry Aadhaar, PAN, Driving License, Metro cards, and more in their palm.

## Key Features

* **Multi-Modal Authentication:** Palm + Face + Gesture + Voice
* **Palm-as-QR:** Pay by showing palm, just like scanning a QR code
* **Voice-Powered Transactions:** Say "Pay 100 to Amit" → Confirm with gesture
* **Emergency SOS Mode:** Special gesture sends live location to emergency contacts
* **Traditional QR Payments:** For backward compatibility
* **Indian Sign Language Support** for inclusivity
* **Cardless Identity (DigiLocker-like):** Store Aadhaar, PAN, Metro card, etc.
* **Contactless Access Control:** Unlock smart locks, offices, metro gates
* **Fun Mode:** AI Palm Reading, Horoscope, Seasonal Greetings
* **Deepfake Prevention:** Liveness checks against photos/videos
* **Privacy First:** Federated learning keeps biometric data private

## Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** React.js / Next.js, TailwindCSS
* **Backend:** FastAPI (Python) or Node.js + Express
* **Database:** SQLite (local), PostgreSQL (production via Supabase)
* **AI & ML:**

  * Palm + Gesture → MediaPipe Hands / TensorFlow\.js
  * Face Recognition → face-api.js / DeepFace
  * Speech Recognition → Vosk API / Browser SpeechRecognition
  * Text-to-Speech → Mozilla TTS / Browser speechSynthesis
* **Hosting:** GitHub Pages (frontend), Railway/Render (backend)

## Usage

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/palmpay.git
   cd palmpay
   ```
2. Run backend (FastAPI):

   ```bash
   cd backend
   uvicorn app:app --reload
   ```
3. Run frontend:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm start
   ```
4. Open browser → `http://localhost:3000`

## Constraints

* Must work on **normal cameras** (no infrared palm vein scanners).
* Payments + ID verification must be **completed within 7 seconds**.
* Data privacy is critical → **no raw biometric stored on central servers**.
* All features should work with **free/open-source tools**.
